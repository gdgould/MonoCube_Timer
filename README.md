# MonoCube Timer

MonoCube Timer is an easy-to-use timer intended for speedcubing, with a particular emphasis on storing and displaying historical solves, scrambles, averages and PB's.

## Supported Platforms

MonoCube Timer is built using the MonoGame Framework, which supports Windows, MacOs, Linux, Android, and iOS/iPadOS.  (For a full list of supported platforms please see <https://www.monogame.net/>).

<b>NOTE</b>: MonoCube Timer 0.5.0.1 has been tested on the following platforms:
* Windows 10 (1920x1080)

Functionality on any operating system not listed above is not guarenteed.  In particular, Android and iOS/iPadOS will almost certainly not function properly, due to low screen resolution (under 1200x640), and lack of touch screen support.  Other devices with screen resolution under 1200x640 may also experience problems.
